# Create-a-Password-and-Evaluate-Its-Strength
Password strength evaluation of user's passwords. User's know their password is strong, very strong or weak.
# 1.Create multiple passwords with varying complexity
Let's create different password with different ranges like weak, strong, very strong, etc.
| **Password**        | **Complexity Level** | **Features Used**                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `password`          | Very Weak            | Lowercase only                                |
| `Password123`       | Good                 | Uppercase + lowercase + numbers               |
| `P@ssw0rd!`         | Moderate             | Uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbol      |
| `rF8#nB3!zL`        | Strong               | Random uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols |
| `Th!sIs$Tr0ngP@ss!` | Very Strong          | Long, complex, mixed case + symbols           |
| `X9%zLp!3Bn@7q!`    | Very Strong          | Random + long + full complexity               |
# 2.Test Each Password on Password Strength Checker
* We can check our password strength on different password Strenght Checker tools or websites.
* Let us consider the one Password Strength Checker website ie, passwordmeter.com
* In that Password Strength Checker gives our password strength by checking the Uppercases, Lowercases, Digits, Special characcters or Symbols.
* A very strong password is nothing but combination all the given cases.
* For example,
    - If we given a password as **github** then it contains only Lowercase alphabets.
    - So, in password strength checker it showes the given is **very weak**
    - If, the given password is combination all cases like **L@7b(jH*k5F-g#** then it displays **very strong** password.
# 3.Note scores and feedback from the tool.
* Common feedback includes:
  - Avoid dictionary words (password, letmein, etc.).
  - Mix upper/lowercase letters.
  - Add symbols and numbers.
  - Use 12+ characters minimum for better protection.
  - Avoid personal info (birthdays, names).
# 4.Best practices for creating strong passwords.
* Best Practices
   - Length matters – At least 12–16 characters.
   - Mix character types – Include:
   - Uppercase (A–Z)
   - Lowercase (a–z)
   - Numbers (0–9)
   - Symbols (!@#$%^&)
   - Avoid personal info – No names, birthdays, pets.
   - Avoid patterns – Like 123456, qwerty, or Password1.
   - Use passphrases – Like "My!DogEats2Tacos@Night".
   - Don’t reuse passwords – Especially for sensitive accounts.
   - Use a password manager – Generates and stores complex passwords.
# 5.Tips learned from the evaluation.
* Tips Learned from Evaluation
  - Random characters are stronger than meaningful words.
  - Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
  - Substituting letters with symbols (e.g., @ for a) only slightly improves weak passwords.
  - Even slightly common passwords with added numbers/symbols can still be predictable.
# 6.Common Password Attacks
* Brute Force Attack
   - What it is: Tries every possible combination until it finds the correct one.
   - Effectiveness: Time-consuming for long, complex passwords.
   - Defense: Long, random, and complex passwords.
* Dictionary Attack
  - What it is: Uses a list of common passwords or words.
  - Effectiveness: Very fast against weak or common passwords.
  - Defense: Avoid dictionary words and patterns.
* Credential Stuffing
  - What it is: Uses known username-password combinations from previous breaches.
  - Defense: Never reuse passwords across sites.
* Social Engineering / Phishing
  - What it is: Trick users into giving up their password.
  - Defense: Be cautious of suspicious emails, links, and login requests.
